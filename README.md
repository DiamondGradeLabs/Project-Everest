# Project Everest

Welcome to Project Everest! 

![Project Everest Logo](https://project-everest-diamongradelabs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/Project+Everest.png)

**Project Everest** is a project to facilitate creation of a framework (Potentially called *Everest*).
This framework is designed to simplify and modernize the Panda3d Game Engine (https://www.panda3d.org/). 

The Game Engine was designed and built by Disney in the early 2000's for use in their game development space. Over the years the game engine has evolved and is currently maintained by Carnegie-Mellon University(https://www.cmu.edu/) under a modified BSD license which is linked below as this project is under the same license. 

Currently the project is not really in a phase per se, but has been given the version of 0.0.1 as really there isn't much to it other than some proof of concept and prototyping code. 


## Contributing

The whole idea of this project is to be open source and be community driven therefore contributing is encouraged.

**Please checkout the** *StartHere* **file under** *Documentation/Support*!

## Building

Currently the only build that is added by default is linux. I will be adding windows build files as soon as I can. At some point a folder with some boilerplate build configuraitons may be added.

As of right now the Makefile has created for g++ and will be modified as the project progresses.
