## Project Setup
This section outlines how the project directory is setup and what each section is for.

 **Assets** - The asset directory is here for when you need to add custom assets to the project for testing. *NOTE: All custom assets must be removed before pushing to the repo. If you believe a asset would be good to add to the project on a long term basis contact the support team*

**Documentation** - The documentation directory is as it sounds. It stores the documentation for the project. This can be the support documents like this or the project design and layout documentation.

**Source** - The source directory stores all of the raw source code for the project. This directory is to be laid out.
