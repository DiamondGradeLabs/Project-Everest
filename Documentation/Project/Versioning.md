# Versioning

This document outlines code version scheme. As well it layouts the version types.

## Versions
The project is broken into versions(much like all other software). The version breaks down into three segments the Major Release, Minor Release and, Intermediate Release.

The Major release is the major iteration of the project. As of right now the major release is **0**. Version 1 will be the first actual stable release of the project.

The Minor release is the minor iteration of the project, this would be sub release updates and encompasses the development version between major releases.

The Intermediate release is the iteration of between minor release that are used to indicate changes in development versions with out changing the Minor release version. 

So for example the version **0.0.1** is used because there have been no actual code changes and this is the first significant iteration of documentation. As well there have not been any patches/bug fixes completed either. 

## Version Type
Versions are broken into types. This helps to delineate between the core function of the version. 
The types and definitions are as follows:
**non-release version** - Non-release version are mainly going to be intermediate and development release where they will not get at the minimum a patch status.
**development-release** - Development releases are just as they sound, a release during the development phase for wide scale testing of new features and bug fixes. 
**patch-release** - Patches are to push bug fixes and patches to a release version of the code.
**stable-release** - Stable release are official release.

## Version Status
Version status is pretty self explanatory it show the current status of the version in the Road-Map page.

Here are the statuses:
**New** - New is for versions that are in the draft phase which means they are open for official version feature/issue fix suggestions to be posted on the version section on the Road Map. 

**Pending** - These are versions that have made it past the draft phase and are not active but approved. Note: Additional suggestions can still be submitted.

**Approved** - These are approved and active versions of the project with the most pressing task that are needing completion.
